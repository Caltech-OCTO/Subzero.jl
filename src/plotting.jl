## What plotting functionality is availible for Subzero simulations?

We provide very basic plotting functionalities for Subzero simulations. Given plotting is so
customizable, we just wanted to provide a roadmap for how a user might plot a simulation and
provide a few utility functions. The user should use our plotting code for early
experimentation and as an exampe of how to create animations with `Makie`.

Below are the stubs of functions that require `CairoMakie` and `GeoInterfaceMakie`. The
actual code for these functions is in `ext/SubzeroMakieExt`. These functions are only loaded
when the user loads `CairoMakie` and `GeoInterfaceMakie`. This prevents unneccesarily long
compiling times when the user just wants to run simulations. They can then load `CairoMakie`
and `GeoInterfaceMakie` once post-simulation runs and create all of the needed videos at
once, rather than loading `CairoMakie` prior to each simulation.

We also provide basic plotting utility functions, like `prettytime`, here as they do
not depend on any of the `Makie packages` and therefore don't need to be abstracted away
into the extension.

    prettytime(t)

Turn time in seconds into units of minutes, hours, days, or years as appropriate
## Aguments:
- `t::Real`: number of seconds
## Returns:
- `::String`: number of seconds converted to a string value in minutes, hours, days, or years with units
## Note:
    This code was modified from the this [source code](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl/blob/master/src/trials.jl).
