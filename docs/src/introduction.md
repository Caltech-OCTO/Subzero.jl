# Introduction

Subzero is an easy-to-use Julia translation of Manucharyan and Montemuro’s model described in the paper “SubZero: A Sea Ice Model With an Explicit Representation of the Floe Life Cycle.” The model has been restructured to leverage Julia’s language abstractions for ease of setting up new simulation runs and allowing more types of simulations without code modifications. It has been designed for stand-alone simulations.

Subzero.jl was ported and restructured by Skylar Gering and originally developed by Georgy Manucharyan and Brandon Montemuro.
