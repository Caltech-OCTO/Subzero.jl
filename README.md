## _Fast and Flexible Sea Ice Dynamics_

Subzero.jl is a native [Julia](https://julialang.org/) discrete-element model (DEM) for exploring fine-scale sea ice dynamics, 
reimplementing and enhancing MATLAB model [SubZero by Manucharyan and Montemuro](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003247).

- ðŸš€ Runs over **35 times faster** that original MATLAB model for title simulation!
- ðŸ§© Modular simulation model makes it easy to **customize simulations**!
  - Enable and disable physical processes such as fracturing, ridging, and welding
  - Choose algorithms for key processes (or add your own!)

## _Documentation_

To learn how to build and run simulations, [check out our documentation and tutorials](https://caltech-octo.github.io/Subzero.jl/dev/)!

## _Installation_

Subzero is not yet a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,

1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (version 1.9 or later).

2. Launch Julia and enter into the package manager mode by typing `]` in the terminal.
   
3. Run the following

```julia
pkg> add "git@github.com:Caltech-OCTO/Subzero.jl.git"
```

This will add the package to your package manager. After that you return to the REPL mode by hitting the backspace and you are ready to use Subzero! 

```julia
julia> using Subzero
```
